### How to become a warm person 
- [[Alain de Botton]]
- [YouTube The School of Life - How to be Warm](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1MolmoFuXu4&pp=ygUbSG93IHRvIGJlY29tZSBhIHdhcm0gcGVyc29u) 
- Cold vs warm politeness comes from our assumptions about others 
- Cold hosts fail make their hospitality engaging or memorable 
- The cold hosts assumptions about other people:
	- Have high needs
	- Interested in serious topics like art and politics 
	- Appreciate formality 
- The warm hosts assumptions about their guests (and themselves)
	- Normal imperfect humans
	- Needy, fragile, confused 
	- a struggling self
