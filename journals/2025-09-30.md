You think LLMs make coding fast? But does it make your team fast?

Everyone's talking about how LLMs make coding fast. But here's what they don't say:

Writing code was never the bottleneck.

The real challenges in software are often: - Code reviews that demand deep context - Knowledge sharing through mentoring & pairing Debugging, testing, and edge case thinking

- Aligning teams across tickets, planning, and communications

When Al generates code, here's what really happens:

L Reviewers face more pressure

Integration & maintenance get harder

If your goal is a collaborative, healthy codebase, generating code fast alone won't save you.

If code is produced faster than it can be reviewed, quality is assumed, not ensured.

Coding assistants in teams are excellent for throwaway code:

Quick automation scripts

Prototypes and demos

- Figuring out if something can even work

Sandboxes to explore new ideas and tools

Sure, coding assistants can also be helpful for production code, but we have to be way more careful to not exacerbate the real challenge of shared understanding, trust, and team alignment.
