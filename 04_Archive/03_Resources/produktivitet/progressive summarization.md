- "Summarization is risky — you may be making the wrong decision about what’s important. But with the safety net of multiple layers of preserved notes, you can strike out decisively on daring intellectual expeditions"

- "Layer 0 is the original, full-length source text.
- Layer 1 is the content that I initially bring into my note-taking program. "
	- "capture anything that feels insightful, interesting, or useful."
- "Layer 2 is the first round of true summarization, in which I bold only the best parts of the passages I’ve imported"
- "Layer 3, I switch to highlighting, so I can make out the smaller number of highlighted passages among all the bolded ones. This time, I’m looking for the “best of the best,” "
- "Layer 4, I’m still summarizing, but going beyond highlighting the words of others, to recording my own. For a small number of notes that are the most insightful, I summarize layers 2 and 3 in an informal executive summary at the top of the note"
- Layer 5 "remix them. After pulling them apart and dissecting them from every angle in layers 1–4, I add my own personality and creativity and turn them into something else.
	- This could include a blog post interpreting, critiquing, or extending the argument an author is making,"
