### The philosophy
-  the books mantra: to “organize for action,”
- a minimalistic way to add just enough order to your environment that you have the clarity to move forward, and no more.
-  After all, only the simplest, most frictionless habits endure long term
- How can you take this chance to be more honest with yourself about which areas of your life need more attention, and organize your digital environment to support them?
- PARA is “platform agnostic,” meaning it is one system that can be implemented everywhere,
- The landscape of productivity software is always changing, but that doesn’t mean your organizing methods have to be. 
### The method
##### Getting started
- Getting started: Dont waste time on reorganizing existing files. 
	- Step 1: Archive existing files 
	- Step 2: Create project folders 
	- Step 3: Create additional folders as needed
- Break down your areas of responsibility into specific, concrete projects.
- Never create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it.
- Create an inbox: The inbox is a temporary holding area where new items accumulate until you have time to put them in their proper place.
- Number the folders 0 - 4
- Use Naming conventions: for example prefix projects with emojis or YYMM_ , capitalize Areas, lowercase resources.
- The four folders are optional. The important principle is to separate out whatever is most actionable and timely and give it the majority of your attention, and there are countless ways to do so. 
##### Maintenance
- 5 minute weekly maintenance:
	- Retitle new items in your inbox 
	- Sort new items into PARA folders
	- Update your active projects
### Theory
- **Projects**: A project has a goal that will enable you to mark it “complete” A deadline or timeframe by which you’d like it done
- **Areas**: Instead of a goal, an area of responsibility has a standard you’re trying to maintain.
- **Areas vs Resources**: Areas are Private Whereas Resources Are Shareable
- there is a big difference between things you are directly responsible for and things you are merely interested in. I use uppercase titles for areas and lowercase titles for resources to constantly remind myself that one is more important than the other

### Other noteworthy take-aways
- You don’t get a prize for starting a book or finishing one. Books are not trophies to collect or evidence you’ve learned anything. The only reward from reading a book like this one comes from putting what you learn into practice,
