## Fill out the three lists below
### What I am currently working on?

### What should I be working on

For each item above, ask yourself why.  
* Does this matter to you or to someone you love?

* If the answer is no to both of the above, cross it off.
* What would happen if the tasks didn't get done? 
	* If the repercussions are benign, cross it off.
