- Tasks: specific, actionable, managable

## Migration
- If a Task has become irrelevant, *strike out* the whole line, starting from the center of Task Bullet itself. 
- If the Task still needs your attention, *migrate* it by turning the “•” into “>”. This signifies that you’ve migrated that Task, then add it to the Task Page of your new Monthly Log or into a Collection.
- "Migration is more than just rewriting your to-dos, it’s about taking time to ask what is important to keep."
- "The purpose of Migrating is to **distill the things that are truly worth the effort**"

## The practices
- [[Mental Inventory]],: Begin  that, a filter to what matters. Responsibilities and goals.
