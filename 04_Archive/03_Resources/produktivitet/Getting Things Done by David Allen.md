A book and a method for productivity
Haven't read the book yet. 
### [Summary by TODOist](https://youtu.be/hZ0KNifv5PU)

1. **Capture**: dump thoughts down in an inbox immediately
2. **Clarify**: Handle items / tasks in inbox
	* Takes less than 2 minutes -> complete immediately
	* No longer actionable or needed -> delete
	* Can be delegated -> assign to someone else
	* Non actionable reference item -> add to as a reference to a relevant project or as a comment to relevant task
	* Future task -> assign due date and a reminder 
	* Requires more than one step -> create a project with the next actionable step
3. **Organize**: 
	* Inbox: first place things go to
		* similar to Inbox in [[the-PARA-method]]
	* Areas of focus / responsibility
		* similar to Areas in [[the-PARA-method]]
	* Actions: things you're going to due next
		* ! use due dates sparingly, rather label as **next**
	* Agendas: 
	* Reference materials: non-actionable items
		* similar to resources in [[the-PARA-method]]
	* Waiting for: Items that have been delegated or are waiting action from someone else
	* Someday / maybe: Things you want to do in the future but  not now
		* Places you to travel, Books you wanna read, Restaurants you wanna eat ...
	* Archive: info that may be of use or interest
		* split into rare use / reference and frequent use / support
	* Trash bin: info that has no potential value
	* Contexts: possibilities and constraints such as tools, places or people that you require in order to get a task done
		* Can be added as label / hashtags in to each task
		* i.e. home, office, calls, anywhere ...
1. **Reflect/Review**: weekly review similar to [[Building a Second Brain]]
2. **Engage**: With the system setup, answer the question what should I do next?
