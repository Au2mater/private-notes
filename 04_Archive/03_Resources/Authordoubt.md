Help me find a new word for that new feeling I get, when I'm reading an article or a post online, and I start doubting whether it's auto-generated with ChatGPT or written by the apparent author. 
It's a mix of cringe, followed by doubt,  disappointment and a fear of whether this will become the new normal and the end of genuine personal pieces of thought.
Creating a new word for such a specific and modern feeling is a creative challenge! Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Authordoubt**: A blend of "author" and "doubt," capturing the uncertainty about the true origin of the text.
2. **Genuinxiety**: Combining "genuine" and "anxiety," reflecting the fear and anxiety about the authenticity of the content.
3. **Botception**: A play on "bot" and "deception," highlighting the suspicion of being deceived by AI-generated content.
1. **Cringenuity**: A mix of "cringe" and "ingenuity," highlighting the discomfort and skepticism about the content's originality.
5. **Syntheskepticism**: A fusion of "synthetic" and "skepticism," emphasizing skepticism towards potentially synthetic content.
6. **Synthesorrow**: Merging "synthetic" and "sorrow," to express the disappointment and sadness over potentially losing genuine human expression.

Do any of these resonate with you, or would you like to explore more options?
