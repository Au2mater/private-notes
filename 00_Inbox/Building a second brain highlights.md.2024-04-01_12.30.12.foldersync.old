You don’t get a prize for starting a book or finishing one. Books are not trophies to collect or evidence you’ve learned anything. The only reward from reading a book like this one comes from putting what you learn into practice, 

to “organize for action,” the books mantra

a minimalistic way to add just enough order to your environment that you have the clarity to move forward, and no more.

After all, only the simplest, most frictionless habits endure long term

break down your areas of responsibility into specific, concrete projects.

Getting started: Dont waste time on reorganizing existing files. Step 1: Archive existing files Step 2: Create project folders Step 3: Create additional folders as needed

never create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it.

Create an inbox: The inbox is a temporary holding area where new items accumulate until you have time to put them in their proper place.

Number the folders 0 - 4

Naming conventions: prefix projects with emojis or YYMM_ , capitalized Areas, lowercase resources.

The four folders are optional. The important principle is to separate out whatever is most actionable and timely and give it the majority of your attention, and there are countless ways to do so. 

5 minute weekly maintenance:

Retitle new items in your inbox 

Sort new items into PARA folders

Update your active projects

a minimalistic way to add just enough order to your environment that you have the clarity to move forward, and no more.

A project has A goal that will enable you to mark it “complete” A deadline or timeframe by which you’d like it done

Instead of a goal, an area of responsibility has a standard you’re trying to maintain.

there is a big difference between things you are directly responsible for and things you are merely interested in. I use uppercase titles for areas and lowercase titles for resources to constantly remind myself that one is more important than the other

Areas Are Private Whereas Resources Are Shareable

How can you take this chance to be more honest with yourself about which areas of your life need more attention, and organize your digital environment to support them?

PARA is “platform agnostic,” meaning it is one system that can be implemented everywhere,

The landscape of productivity software is always changing, but that doesn’t mean your organizing methods have to be.
