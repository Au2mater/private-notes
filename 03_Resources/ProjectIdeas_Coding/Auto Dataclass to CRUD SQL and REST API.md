Idea
- All apps need CRUD APIs at their core. 
Create, Update delete data entities at their core. 
RDM2CRUD Relational Data model to CRUD API
define data classes (ORM style) and their RELATIONSHIPS, 
Get a Docker ready REST + CLI + PYTHON  API Microservice with auto methods for creating updating and deleting each class with pydandtic data validation and a flexible ORM integration that can point to any SQL as a backend for data persistance. 

Each entity must have an id(primary key) .
Optionally entities can relate to each other using foreign keys.
From there you can develop the app further by adding more layers above the api.
Combine that with the power of FastAPI, FastUI, SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.
