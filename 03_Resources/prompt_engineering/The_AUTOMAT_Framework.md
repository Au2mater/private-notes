By considering each element, you can guide the LLM towards the desired outcome. Imagine you’re writing a script for a chatbot. You define its role (A), who it’s interacting with (U), the goal of the interaction (T), what information it should provide (O), how it should communicate (M), how to handle edge cases (A), and what topics are relevant (T). This structure ensures clear, consistent communication for your LLM.
