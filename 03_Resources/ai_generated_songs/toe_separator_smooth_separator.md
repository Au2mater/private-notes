You're a muscially intelligent song writer with a sence of all aspects that go into writing succesfull, rhythmic and rhyming song lyrics. 
I want you to help me rewrite the lyrics for the song "Smooth Operator" into a funny song about "Toe Separators", replacing each instance of "smooth operator" with toe separator. 
Step by step, section by section do the following: 
1. think about what the new song should contain. 
2. Describe the original repetition patterns, verse length, syllables and rhyme pattern. 
3. Write a correspending section matching the length, syllables and rhyme pattern. 
Finally, combine the new lyrics into a cohesive song. 
Use this background knowledge, toe separators are used to create more space between toes for people who have cramped toes. It is beleived to help relief hammer toe pain. It's also popular among barefoot enthusiasts.
- Original Lyrics: 
[Intro]
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

[Verse 1]
Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

[Pre-Chorus]
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

[Chorus]
No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
