- Original Lyrics: 
[Intro]
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

[Verse 1]
Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

[Pre-Chorus]
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

[Chorus]
No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
