Digital Adaptation of  [[the-bullet-journal-method]]

### Benefits - Why I prefer digital note taking
* **Search**: probably the most powerful benefit of digital note-taking
* **Links**: links to internal notes, and external URLs
* **Speed**: fast-typing for better speed logging on the go
* **Size**: always have all your notes with you, on your phone.
* **Backup**: if done properly, you'll never loose these precious notes.
### [[Mental Inventory]]
### Handwriting
* handwriting (digital?) is powerful
* deliberate slow writing, few words, just enough
* say it with your own words 
* the therapeutic practice of  journaling
* keep it short and hassle free 
## The System
* Can serve as a Todo-list, Journal and Calendar all-in-one
* As a calendar 
	* Haven't yet been able to give up the convenience and reliability of a well-managed sharable digital calendar
	* The loose structure of monthly and daily log can serve as a great supplement to the calendar. You have the freedom to not be precise here and have a birds view close to your space for thought and reflection 
	* You can keep your calendar as your source of truth, while using the practice of rewriting the noteworthy events that will happen in your daily and monthly log to help yourself check in, reflect and plan. 
	* Great for events, where the precise date and time hasn't been decided yet. 
	* Here you can also continously add note worthy non planned events, after they happen. 
* **The Index**: a navigational tool.
	* Not useful 
		* No page numbers, we have search. 
	* Map-of-Contents "Collection" notes, with links, is a good digital alternative.
* **Future Log**: future tasks and events, outside of the current month.
	* Not sure about this
	* Too much work if you have a digital calendar?
	* However, the practice of maintaining it forces you to plan and prioritize!
* **Monthly Log**: tasks and events for current month.
	* same thoughts as Future Log
	* Serves as a monthly [[Mental Inventory]], main benefit
* **Daily Log**: bullets, keep it short
	* start here, then escalate/extract a block to a collection if necessary 
	* ideally, every collection links back to the daily note it came from. 
- **Collection**: any non Periodic Log note 
	- project, area and resource notes (PARA)
* **Tasks** status signifiers:
	* [ ] A task that requires you to act upon it (Ctrl+L)
	* [ ] A finished task (Ctrl+L on an existing note)
	* >a task moved to the next Monthly Log or a Collection
	* [>] a task moved to the next Monthly Log or a Collection - [BuJo bullets plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=bujo-bullets)

	* Implicitly indicated by the heading (# What's happening today? / Events / Calendar)
