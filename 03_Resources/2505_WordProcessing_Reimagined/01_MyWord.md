The office document editor reimagined.
Starting Microsoft Word, let's reimagine what a modern day, office document editor, for non creative users, should look like.
We will strip away overrated, and outdated functionality.
We will introduce new valuable features.
1. Blazing fast start up. No matter the document size.
	* Lazy load.
	* I need to launch in less than two seconds
	* For blank startup, I need to look at page one of my new blank document immediately. 
	* For editing documents, I need to see page one immediately, no need to wait for page 1000 to load.
2. Forget the page.
	1. who prints today.
	2. why should a pragraph be split.
	3. 
3. No word art!
	1. ...
4. Core markdown styling principles
	1. No custom text alignment 
		1. auto alignment according to language
	2. No font sizes.
		1. all you need is headings and zoom.
	3. One font.
	4. One highlighting colour
	5. The design is a user defined preview but can be embedded for occasional printing and PDF export.
5. Themes
	1. themes control colour palettes and advanced rule based styling. 
6. The main objective of the software 
	1. Editing: abstract the simple markdown syntax into an intuitive UI and translate the users needs to some form of markdown compatible format.
	2. Previewing: 
7. Business critical information is no longer saved into a proprietary format. You'll always be able to read your markdown files on any machine.
