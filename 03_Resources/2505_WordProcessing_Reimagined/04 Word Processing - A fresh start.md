- **Component-Based Documents**  
    Think of a document as a living assembly of blocks—text paragraphs, data tables, charts, code snippets—that can be versioned, embedded and reused.
    
- **Real-Time, Web-Native Collaboration**  
    Everyone edits simultaneously, with granular permissions (read, comment, edit) at the block or even sentence level.
    
- **AI as a First-Class Citizen**  
    Inline suggestions, auto-summaries, rewriting tones, instant translation—all powered by local or cloud-connected models.
    
- **Semantic Markup & Multiple Views**  
    Author in an outliner, review in a card-deck view, export to print-quality PDF or HTML with the same underlying structure.
    
- **Modular, Secure Extensibility**  
    A plugin ecosystem built on web standards (JavaScript, WASM); granular permission model so extensions can’t leak data or run rogue macros.
    
- **Lightweight, Responsive UI**  
    Minimal core interface that adapts to the user’s current task—drafting, reviewing, presenting—rather than drowning you in ribbons of buttons.
