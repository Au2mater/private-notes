## 1. Monolithic, File-Based Model

- **Rigid “.docx”/“.odt” container**  
    Documents live in single, opaque files that bundle text, styles, images and metadata. You can’t easily reference or reuse individual elements (e.g. a chart) across multiple documents without cumbersome copy-paste or exports.
    
- **Poor versioning**  
    Track changes and “Versions” menus are bolted on; true version control (diffs, branches, merges) is painful or impossible.

## 2. Siloed, Asynchronous Collaboration

- **Check-in/check-out or email “round-trips”**  
    You send someone a file, they edit, they send it back. Real-time co-authoring (in Word Online or Collabora) is a later add-on and still feels like a patched-on feature.
    
- **Lack of granular permissions**  
    You share the whole document, not just a single section or comment thread.

## 3. UI/UX Inertia

- **Toolbars 20 years in the making**  
    The Ribbon, menus and dialogs are stuffed with features few people use. This complexity raises the barrier to entry for occasional writers.
    
- **Page-layout focus**  
    Designed primarily for print; on-screen reading and responsive layouts get second fiddle.

## 4. Limited Extensibility & Integration

- **Macro security nightmares**  
    VBA macros enabled powerful automation but became top malware vector. Modern plugins still feel like “apps within an app,” often clunky to install and update.
    
- **Weak API for external data**  
    Integrating live data (spreadsheets, APIs, databases) requires add-ins or exports, rather than native, reactive embedding.

## 5. Missing AI-First Capabilities

- **Spell-check only goes so far**  
    Grammar suggestions, style guides and tone-analysis are third-party add-ons or cloud-only features.
    
- **No built-in content generation**  
    Drafting, summarizing or translating still relies on copy-paste from external tools.

## 6. Static, Linear Editing Paradigm

- **WYSIWYG vs. structured content**  
    What-you-see-is-what-you-get breaks down for richly structured or semantic documents (e.g. technical specs, academic papers, web content).
    
- **Linear flow only**  
    You scroll down a single, fixed canvas; outliners and mind-map views exist but feel tacked on.

## 7. Legacy-Driven Performance & Accessibility Constraints

- **Heavy desktop footprint**  
    Gigabyte downloads, slow startup times, auto-saves that stall your typing.
    
- **Accessibility as an afterthought**  
    Real-time screen-reader testing, adaptive layouts and mobile editing still lag behind web-native alternatives.

## 8. Page-Centric Design in a Paperless World

- **Printing is no longer the norm**  
    Word and Writer still revolve around “pages”—a concept tied to physical paper. But in a world where most documents are read on screens, shared via links, or embedded into apps, the page is a relic.
    
- **Artificial constraints**  
    Page breaks, margins, footers, line spacing—all optimize for print layout, not screen readability. They add complexity without improving user outcomes.
    
- **Lost potential for responsive design**  
    Modern documents should adapt fluidly to mobile, tablet, desktop, or voice. Page-oriented design locks content into static frames.
    

**Cost of this legacy:**

- Wasted screen space
    
- Inconsistent formatting between screen and print
    
- Confusing UI complexity for elements that few people use (headers, print margins, page numbers)

## 9. Proprietary File Formats and Locked-In Knowledge

- **Knowledge should be durable and portable**  
    For students, businesses, and governments, documents often represent intellectual capital—policies, contracts, research, creative work. Storing this knowledge in closed formats (like `.docx`) ties it to a single vendor’s roadmap.
    
- **Forced trade-off: power vs. freedom**  
    Use Word and get advanced features—but risk vendor lock-in, expensive licensing, and poor interoperability. Use open formats and gain control—but lose formatting fidelity or feature support.
    

**But does it have to be this way?**  
No. A new standard could combine:

- **Open, structured formats** (e.g. Markdown+, HTML5, or JSON-based models)
    
- **Separation of content and presentation**
    
- **Interoperable rendering engines** (à la browsers for websites)
    
- **Self-describing components** that can evolve without breaking backwards compatibility
